# Spatial-representation-and-GDIM
This is a new perspective about the spatial representation, also a proof of GDIM.
Perhaps we can represent the coordinate axes without using straight lines.

Space does not change its position because of how it is expressed, just like 'apple', '苹果' and itself. 🍎
May be used in feature selection, DeepLearning...

Please see the paper 'Spatial-temporal evolution of carbon emissions and their influencing factors in Shandong Province, China' a few months later, in the discussion section.
